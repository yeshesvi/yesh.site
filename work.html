            <h2>Tips by text - Anonymous tips to the Police</h2>
            <h5>Desktop Software Design and User Experience Research</h5>
              <p>
                Me along with two other University of Michigan graduate students have worked alongside the Jackson Police Department to design and create a software program for the police to receive anonymous texts.
                With the help of this software, residents of Jackson are able to send anonymous tips from their mobile phones (both feature phones and smartphones) without revealing their identity to the police. The police receive the entirety of the tip, but the phone number is stripped from the tip and encrypted by the program.
                The project was developed with intense consideration to reduction of operating, training and maintenance costs.</p>
              <p></p>
                 The system can be setup with a minimal 200$ desktop and a 100$ per month cost. Software is also accessible via web and designed to look closely like an email client that the police are trained to use already.
                This allows police to disperse justice better while tip callers don't risk being labeled in their neighborhoods.
                Please see the “seelio” project files in the link below to learn more about my role in the project.

          <h2>Working Bikes, Chicago</h2>
          <h4>Technology blueprint and workflow analysis</h4>
          <p>
            I visited Working Bikes office area in Chicago, Illinois, interviewed various stakeholders at working bikes, including employees and volunteers and drew out a technology blueprint for improving the efficiency of the processes at Working Bikes.</p>
          <p>
            The basis for the project was a user-centered data analysis methodology called contextual design. This process relies upon the contextual inquiry interview, in which the consultant observes the client in their ordinary work environment. We asked the interviewees simple, open questions about their workflow and the work they do to gain a greater understanding of how Working bikes works as an organization. After the interviews, we conferred to interpret the interviews.

              <h2>School of Natural Resources and Environment, Ann Arbor</h2>
              <h4>Information flow and internal information systems analysis.</h4>
              <p>
                Part of the User Experience that is provided by an organization is oftern a reflection of itself and how accessible / inaccessible information is to them. This was perfecly apparent to me, when I was working for the School of Natural Resources and Environment at the University of Michigan, looking at the causes for student dissatisfaction with the office of careers and office of academics.
              </p>
              <p>
                By Heuristic analysis, shadowing and Contextual Inquiry our team of User Experience Researchers found that internal roadblocks due to old technologies and policies are causing data mismanagement and coordination issues. These issues ranged from duplicate information about the same thing being pushed to students and staff by various offices to some information being lost and not provided to the students at all. Our team has developed and presented a report to the management of the school about our findings and suggested courses of action.

                <h4>User experience analysis of support area of their website</h4>
                <p>
                  A2Hosting is a local company at Ann Arbor with global customers. They provide fast "Solid-state drive" based hosting for small and medium businesses as well as private individuals. Their rapid expansion caused their customer support to be overwhelmed. After a thorough review they found out that customer usage of knowledgebase and other resources to fix minor issues themsleves is very low. So, our team was brought in to analyze the User experience of the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While analysing the support section, we have conducted extensive interviews with the support personnel, a few long-term as well as new customers and users of other hosting services. By Contextual Inquiry, Heuristic Analysis, User Testing and Surveys, we have developed weekly reports with findings and suggestions to improve the interface or fix user experience errors and finally made a video presentation summarizing our findings.
